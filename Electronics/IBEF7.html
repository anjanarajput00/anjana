                of electronics goods including exports worth <br>US$ 120 billion, which would account for 9-10% of the
                overall global value chains, from the current supply potential of 1-2%.

            </p>

            <p>Union Budget 2023-24 has allocated Rs. 16,549 crore (US$ 2 billion) for the Ministry of Electronics and
                Information Technology, which is nearly 40% higher on <br>year. The budget for FY23 had allocated Rs.
                14,300
                crore (US$ 1.73 billion) for the IT ministry.

            <p>The Indian startup ecosystem is experiencing a surge over the years, due to rapid technological
                advancements, increasing internet penetration, growing <br>digital infrastructure, rising startup
                culture,
                government initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, and Startup India, as well as a large pool of
                skilled <br>workforce.

            </p>

            <p>India has witnessed an exceptional surge in the creation and funding of startups as the country has
                solidified its position as a major global centre for <br>innovation and businesses. However, securing
                adequate funding remains a significant task for startups, often leading to survival challenges.

            </p>

            <p>In 2023, the funding scenario for tech startups turned bleak amid the global uncertainty, witnessing a
                67% YoY plunge in total funding to US$ 6.0 billion. <br>This decline came after the peak funding levels
                observed in 2021 (US$ 24.1 billion) and 2022 (US$ 18.2 billion), where investors displayed confidence in
                Indian <br>tech startups. In 2023, the number of deals declined to 824. However, the decline appears to
                be
                cyclical than a long-term trend.

                    facility worth US$ 7.5 billion in India; the facility will supply everything <br>from 5G devices to
                    electric cars.
                </li>
                <li>In September 2021, the Indian Institute of Technology Indore and the Confederation of Indian MSME in
                    Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) and <br>Information Technology (CIMEI), signed a
                    Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate and share knowledge and best practices as well as
                    offer <br>technological support for the growth of Indian start-ups and SMEs.
                </li>
                <li>In May 2021, the cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi, approved a proposal by the
                    Department of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises to <br>implement the Production Linked
                    Incentive
                    (PLI) scheme 'National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage’ to achieve
                    manufacturing <br>capacity of 50 GWh (Giga Watt Hour) of ACC and 5 GWh of ‘Niche’ ACC, with an
                    outlay of
                    Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.47 billion).
                </li>
                <li>The key government initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ improved the country’s
                    EoDB. In 2021-22, the total budget allocation towards the ‘Digital <br>India’ programme is Rs.
                    6,806.33
                    crore (US$ 936.19 million).
                </li>
                <li>To accelerate quantum computing-led research & development and enable new scientific discoveries,
                    the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology <br>(MeitY), in collaboration with Amazon Web
                    Services (AWS), will establish a quantum computing applications lab in the country.
                </li>
                <li>A fund of Rs. 3.2 crore (US$ 433.46 thousand) for three years has been approved by the Department of
                    Electronics, IT, BT, Science & Technology.
                </li>
                <li>Under the PLI scheme for IT Hardware, the approved enterprises are estimated to manufacture
                    equipment worth >US$ 21.62 billion over the next four years. Of the <br>total production, foreign
                    companies have suggested production worth US$ 11.38 billion, whereas domestic enterprises have
                    planned a production of US$ 10.20 <br>billion.

                        Local electronics design and production are being positively influenced by ongoing <br>domestic
                        consumption, changing dynamics in the global supply chain, and a plethora <br>of policy initiatives
                        to assist indigenous manufacturing in the current period is most <br>advantageous. The smooth
                        implementation of new initiatives and the reversal of <br>restrictive laws will go a long way toward
                        boosting international business confidence in <br>India's business environment and attracting
                        manufacturing investments.
                    </li>
                    <li>In India, Sony, Samsung, LG Electronics, Panasonic, and other companies are the <br>market leaders
                        in the ESDM sector. Government efforts are concentrated on bridging <br>the digital gap. Projects
                        like "Digital India," "Smart Cities," "ePanchayats," "National <br>Optical Fiber Network," etc.
                        enhanced consumer demand for electronic goods around <br>the nation. India's middle class is rapidly
                        expanding, which has improved the <br>affordability of electronics products. The demand for
                        electronic goods has increased as <br>consumers' preferences for products and devices with smart
                        technology (like smart <br>LED TVs) and inventive designs have changed and disposable incomes have
                        increased. <br>Continuous rise in personal disposable income in India increased to reach 2,410 in
                        FY23, <br>which is directly correlated with consumers' desire to spend money on electronics.</li>

            <div class="ro2">
                <p>
                    Fueled by strong policy support, huge investments by public and private stakeholders and a spike
                        in demand for electronic products, the ESDM sector in <br>India has bright prospects ahead of it and
                        is predicted to reach US$ 220 billion by 2025, expanding at 16.1% CAGR between 2019-2025.
